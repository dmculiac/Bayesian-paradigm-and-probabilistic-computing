# Reverend Thomas Bayes
                                        
                                        
                                        -------and probabilistic programming-------

Questioning what appeared to be evidence or tests about evidence was entrenched in Thomas Bayes belief system. His beliefs were not absolute and evidence was summoned once again to test the strength of those beliefs. I have to admit, this is a head scratching exercise. While it makes sense on a higher level, when we get into the nuts and bolts, it completely changes how we look at things.



Bayes rule computes the actual probability of an event given some information about the tests related to that event. Bayes rule takes the test result and calculates the real probability that the test has identified the event.



All said and done, this joke has a lot more meat than meets the eye:

*A Bayesian is one who vaguely expecting a horse and catching a glimpse of a donkey, they strongly believe they've seen a mule*
